# Lecture Notes: Algebraic Geometry 1 
This repo contains the working files for my personal lecture notes for the Algebraic Geometry 1 lecture being taught in the Winter term of 2024/25 by Prof. Dr. Daniel Huybrechts are the University of Bonn.

Note that these notes are **not** linearly following the lecture.
I am writing them primarily for my own use and therefore omitting things I already know (this in particular includes many facts and concepts from category theory and homological algebra).
On the other hand, I will also add material that is relevant to the lecture which I don't feel quite comfortable with (e.g. things from commutative algebra). Caveat lector.
